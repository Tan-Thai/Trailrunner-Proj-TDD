# TDD-Diary

## Summary

## Introduction

The general structure of the diary will follow a daily chapter including the goals and solutions to said goals.
Reflections and comments will be added as deemed necessary for clarity. Each day will in most cases start with a checklist
to assure that no side-quests are made. 

The entire project is set up as a repository on GitHub for version control and ease of access.
