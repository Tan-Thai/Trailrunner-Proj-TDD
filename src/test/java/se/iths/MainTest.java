    * Ironically quite lost here, I need to write tests for:
    * - Switch cases for the user to choose to change user info or add sessions
    * - Showcase of sessions > detail view of 'x' sessions
    * - Deletion of sessions (selection)
    * - Search for x session
    * - Close the program
    * - Potentially anything else related to user experience in menu.
