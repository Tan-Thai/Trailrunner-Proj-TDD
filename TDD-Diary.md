# TDD-Diary

## Summary

## Introduction

The general structure of the diary will follow a daily chapter including the goals and solutions to said goals.
Reflections and comments will be added as deemed necessary for clarity. Each day will in most cases start with a checklist
to assure that no side-quests are made. 

The entire project is set up as a repository on GitHub for version control and ease of access.
Maven and Jacoco is used within the project as of writing. If VG assignments are made then Mockito was used as well.

Preface: I did work with **FileStorage** right away and then reformated it to suit my needs. I'll add it again
if I do work on the VG part of the assignment.

## Day 1 - 08/01-25

- [x] Set up repository and skeleton to start project.
- [x] Write up initial mockup of diary.
- [x] Start feature-branch.
- [x] Create **Record** class and it's tests.
- [x] Implement tests for **FileStorage**. (now named **RecordHandler**)
- [x] Adjust **FileStorage** until functional according to tests. (now named **RecordHandler**)
- [x] Create a **RecordHandler** that contains a Map to use ID as keys to avoid duplications.
- [ ] Create a **Calculator** for all formulas and math needed for the project.
- [ ] Create a **Main** that will allow the user to input and use the program.
 

### Agenda
Create a **RecordTest** file to create tests which includes all variables included in Records (variables based on
parameters from **FileStorage**).

After baseline tests are made, create **Record** class and shape it to fit tests.

---
### Fleeting Notes
Record might not be the best word for the files, not sure what to call a "saved trip/run/walk". As much as I want to
name it "session", it might does not sound entirely correct either.

### RecordTests
Noticed that I did write a few scuffed initial drafts for the tests due to not having coded for about 2 weeks.
Note to self to make sure to stay on top of coding whenever on break, even if it's just a little bit of code.

Example of issues were:
- The initial structure.
- Asserts having the expected/actual in swapped positions.
- Somehow forgetting the () when calling to methods. (I'm honestly baffled that it just slipped my mind)
- I missed that id was a string initially. (I blame it on new year)

### FileStorage
Will rename this file to **RecordHandler** to simplify the naming-scheme. Also, easier to identify what it's connected to
in my opinion.

### RecordHandler

Might be overdoing it with throws and checks during the test, but I'm giving it a go to do a thorough test-setup
to see how far I can push my own knowledge of working TDD. (which I'm not used to)

Lots of new things came up such as writing tests for exception-handling and throws. Stumbled upon a few issues that I
had to resort to Stack Overflow. Based on the projects tests now, it seems to be fully functional and work as intended.
I'm still not feeling 100% confident regarding this so it will have to be something I work with more down the line.

## Day 2 - 09/01-25 to 10/01-25

- [x] Rename **Record** to something more relatable and self-explanatory. (Now **Session**) 
- [x] Create a **CalculatorTest** for all formulas and math needed for the project.
- [x] Create a **Calculator** to code in said formulas.
- [ ] Create a **Main** that will allow the user to input and use the program.
- [x] Create a **User** that will handle user data.
- [ ] Advanced G assignments. (Kept as a single point for now)
- [ ] Start on VG assignments.
- [x] Create tests for a singleton **Scanner**. Accidentally made prior to tests.

### Agenda
Continue from previous days leftovers and work from there. Goal is to ideally get the G assignments done by end of day.
If possible also add the advanced features into it before working on VG assignments.

Combined 2 dates into "day 2" because of my narcolepsy hindering me from working on the project for the majority
of 09/01.

### Fleeting Notes
As discussed with Max during yesterday's lesson, **Record** was not a fitting name for what we are trying
to save. Two potential names were "**Session**" and "**Activity**". Noted within agenda to keep track as of why
the change was made.

Debating if "TotalFitnessScore" should be a value stored with SessionHandler or User. If kept with the handler then it's
stored with all the sessions it has within the collection, logical. But since it's a fitness app and revolves around
the user, then storing the score with the user also works. Especially if we want to enable user to "remove" sessions but
keep their score (or if they re-install the app from a new phone for example).

### Calculator
(âœ…)TODO: Set up all calculations needed for a session.

Calc consists of:
- Average speed
- Kilometres per hour/min
- "FitnessScore" (score based on session) \
  FitnessScore **needs** to show a positive integer and only whole numbers. Score starts at 0 if it's the **first**
  session.
- Total distance traveled across all sessions.
- Average distance traveled across all sessions.

#### Reflections
Creating tests for these as opposed to coding them up first is way trickier due to the need of "foresight"
for how the formulas will be used. All without coding it up. I'm fully aware that we only care about the output to assert,
but I'm the type that wants to understand how the process goes before making a tests. It helps me visualise it better.

The first few tests worked fine but FitnessScore was a bit more troublesome to make up. Both due to it
having 2 conditions over it being the first ever session or not, and the fact that it needs to make use of
"days since the previous session" for the formula. This means that you can't just send in a single session but now needs
either 2 latest sessions to calculate the days between, or send in the whole handler and extract the 2 latest sessions.

*Extended break between previous text and following (about 18h)*

The calculation between the "days since previous session" was the most troublesome to write tests for and code up.
The rest were on an acceptable level and got sorted quite fast. I do think I need more practice to *not* think about each
individual code and just work with the logic of input/output. I consider calculator to be complete for now though, there
are places I can improve or make better. But I would like to get a proper MVP before refactoring something that already 
works.

### Main

I've had somewhat of a hard time with creating tests for main. One reason being that I'm not sure if I should create
a second file called MenuHandler to essentially create/handle all types of menu system that will be needed for the 
different actions the user shall be able to make. The second reason is that it requires a lot of "human" input through
scanner. My initial thought would be to use "System.setIn", similar to ScannerSingletonTest, but I've been contemplating
mockito. The idea is to essentially "mock" the inputs and test from there. If it does turn out working well then I'll 
most likely proceed to adjust the old tests to fit it. Will probably do a refactoring pass for all code eventually.


### User

User will be kept barebones for now and only contain whatever the assignment asks for + name.
Test are there to just ensure that setting and getting the names works as intended.
